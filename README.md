[portal-ui](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui) now uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and we have experimented with CI deployments to [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/). At the same time, the idea that different teams could use a shared React library never bore fruit.

# Portal style guide

Source code for the Material-UI style guide for HuBMAP.
It is deployed on [GH Pages](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/portal-style-guide/).

## Getting started

In the project directory, run

```
npm install
npm start
```

A development server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deploy updates

Create a feature branch, and make your edits.
When the branch is merged back to master, the GH Pages will be regenerated.
